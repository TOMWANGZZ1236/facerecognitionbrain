## Introduction
The Smart Attendance Application helps professors efficiently track class attendance through a user-friendly online platform. Using cutting-edge machine learning model, the app analyzes images of the classroom to determine how many of the students are present, simplifying the attendance tracking process.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Developed using TailwindCSS, React, and Redux for a responsive and interactive user interface.
- **Backend**: Utilizes PostgreSQL for database management, with Express.js and Node.js powering the server-side logic.
- **AI Technology**: Integrates the Clarifai API for accurate face detection.
- **Deployment**: Hosted on Render to ensure high availability and performance.

## How It Works
1. **Create an Account and Sign In**: Start by signing up or logging into your existing account.
2. **Create a Course**: Set up a new course or select an existing one that you want to track.
3. **Upload a Class Image**: Submit an image of your class during a session.
4. **Check Attendance**: The system processes the image using face detection and provides an attendance report showing the percentage of students present.
